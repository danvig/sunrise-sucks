                        1. Bring up <a href="#"><i>Shutout!</i></a> on the studio's filmography and you will find that the bums at Sunrise make no mention of Loretta Fisher at all.
                        One would expect some sort of a tribute to the actress at the very least. The studio is obviously pretending that she never existed at 
                        all because it has something to hide.
                    </p><br><br>

                    <p>
                        2. Check out <a href="#"><i>Path To Gold</i></a> in the studio's filmography and you will find that Elaine Varsi receives no tribute for her work in the Sunrise film. 
                        One would think that a studio with nothing to hide would put a photo of her in the Actor's Biography section of their website. You can look at
                        <img src="assets/chap6/goldner.gif" style="float:left;"> Willis Goldner, another fallen Sunrise star, and see the tribute that the studio gives 
                        him. It smells like a cover-up to me.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        3. For Martin Stevens' revengeful ways check out mention in John Milton's Diary - entry Day Thirty-Eight - of some strange, fatal "accidents" in 
                        the commissary. I believe that Martin Stevens is behind these events. Especially, since Hawken Jones, DP from the <i>Stab</i> films, died on his watch. 
                        Perhaps, Martin blames Hawken for his son Phil's death.
                    </p><br><br>

                    <p>
                        For further proof on the evidence of SunLies Studio's dispicable and horrific ways presented in my first entry check out the following on their 
                        website Sunrisestudios.com-
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        1.  In John Milton's diary, you will find hidden within the "Day Thirty" entry a very special love message to Beverly Choi. He calls her the best 
                        agent in the industry. Anyone in the know understands that this is a crock of you know what. Only a lover would say such a thing in a public 
                        setting. This entry further proves my theory that Milton and Choi are rolling in sack together. What a disgrace!
