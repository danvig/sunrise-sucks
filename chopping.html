                        You will find that all is not as it seems in the Executive tree at Sunlies Studios. Commissary Chef Martin Stevens is hiding a very big 
                        secret from the world. What secret could a Chef have, you ask... Well, he is none-other-than the father of Phil Stevens, one of the victims 
                        in horrible slayings during the infamous Cincinnati <i>Stab</i> preview screening. Yes, that's right, a Sunrise Employee's son lost his life because 
                        of a Sunlies flick!
                    </p>
                    <a href="enlargements/vernon_memo.html"><img src="assets/chap4/chopping_pict1.gif" style="float:right;"></a>
                    <p>
                        Here I will show you how Martin Stevens tried to avenge Phil's death only to be thwarted by Sunlies security guru, Vernon Duke, and swayed 
                        by the powers of Don Crosby's money.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By reading an internal <a href="enlargements/vernon_memo.html">Sunrise Security Memo</a> and a subsequent top secret <a href="enlargements/report_pg1.html">Sunrise Security Report</a> you will learn about how there was a rash 
                        of vandalism immediately following Phil's death with promises of much more sinister activities to come.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        According to these documents, Martin Stevens stole his own knives from the commissary and threatened Sunlies sleazeball Don Crosby through a 
                        series of violent incidents that could have escalated into much more if not for the swift investigation by Vernon Duke. It's a shame that 
                        the sleaze factory acted so quickly. Evidently, when the Studio discovered Martin's personal involvement in the preview screening murders 
                        and his subsequent revenge tactics Crosby paid Stevens off to keep him quiet about his links to the murder. The sleazeball was less 
                        concerned with Martin's grieving than he was with keeping the idea that some sicko might be targeting employees of Sunlies under wraps.

                    <p>
                        In the following evidence, you will also find a copy of the check that the studio issued to the chef 
                        for $400,000 to keep his story quiet. I have a feeling that after people read this, it won't be quiet for long! You hear me Gale Weathers?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Regardless of the cash that Sunlies bestowed on Stevens, many feel that he is still a "loose cannon" (Vernon Duke's words) who could go off 
                        at any point. With his handy knowledge of knives and his vendetta against the Studio, he is threat to them and, of course, to the upcoming 
                        production <i>Stab 3</i>. It seems that he was watched with a very close eye during <i>Stab 2's</i> creation and release and went without incident. But, 
                        you still never know when someone who's still angry might blow! Could he be a threat to the sleaze factory's latest hit? Only time will tell.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you check out the latest installment in John Milton's producer notes on the <i>Stab 3</i> page in the Trilogy section of Sunrise Studio's website, 
                        you will find evidence that time might already be telling as there are several suspicious events surrounding the commissary.
