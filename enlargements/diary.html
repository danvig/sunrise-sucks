                        "Donald really scared me today on set. He can't accept the fact that I don't love him anymore. I've moved on, but he hasn't. It doesn't help 
                        that we have to keep our love affair a secret because of Diane. It means that I can't talk to anyone but you, Mr. Diary. Not my mom, not my 
                        sister, not anybody. It also means that he and I have to keep our discussions secret. When he came to my trailer during a break from shooting, 
                        I finally worked up the courage to tell him that I don't love him. He went crazy, slinging my make-up tray across the room and telling me that 
                        no one can walk out on him. I was lucky that Mimi Patterson interrupted us to go over some lines because I think he was going to get violent 
                        with me. It was horrible! I hope that his threats were just adolescent, idle ones.

                        Later, I found Reilly York, the co-star of the film, waiting by my car. He was in costume dressed as the killer and looked really scary. He 
                        joked around a little and then he told me that he really thought I looked sexy in my cheerleader outfit. I thanked him and tried to get in my 
                        car. He stopped me and tried to put his tongue in my mouth. I pushed him away, but he was very aggressive. I think Donald saw this from across 
                        the parking lot. I hope he didn't think anything of it. I finally got Reilly to stop, but Donald was gone. I drove straight home looking in my 
                        rearview mirror the whole time. I hope that Janice gets home soon, but I think she's working late at the go-go bar tonight. I'm very nervous! 
                        But, like my ma in Kansas always said, 'tomorrow's another day.' Goodnight, Diary."
