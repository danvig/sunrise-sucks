                        Despite his participation as a spokesman in the "Just Say No" anti-drug campaign, Michael "Night Rider" Neithardt was spotted several 
                        times in the company of none other than the "king" of Hollywood bad boys, Harlin Kingsley. Dancers at "Slippers" adult nightclub say 
                        Neithardt and Kingsley often made late night visits to the club and were seen doing drugs between lap dances. The volatile duo were even 
                        known to pick random fights with tourists on Hollywood Boulevard, though police never managed to prove they were responsible for the 
                        assaults. were even known to pick random fights with tourists on Hollywood Boulevard, though police never managed to prove they were 
                        responsible for the assaults. More interesting is the fact that Harlin Kingsley, the illegitimate son of Mimi Patterson and the late 
                        Don Gordon, was making weekly visits to the <i>Stab 2</i> set. "Kingsley was here all the time," said Janet McFadden, the assistant director. 
                        "What seemed weird to me, however, was how he always made a quick stop at (producer) John Milton's trailer on his way out." Kingsley has 
                        several counts of drug possession on his record and though Milton claims to be clean and sober, there is little doubt that Kingsley was 
                        his drug connection.

                        Below is a deposited check, discovered by my investigators, that shows that on January 24, 1998, John Milton paid Harlin Kingsley $2200 for 
                        "entertainment." On this same day, Kingsley's signature can be found on the register in the gate security office. You might also be interested 
                        to know that John Milton left early that day, complaining of "a migraine headache."
